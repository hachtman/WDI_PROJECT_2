## Technology

## Planning

#### Ideation
I initially wanted to use an ordnance survey API to map various sets of boundaries in the UK and use a heat map to display another set of data like traffic accidents. In the end however I decided to try and make a game out of Google maps. The goal was to test users' geographical knowledge by dropping them in a random location on  Google street view and having them guess where they were.
